E.F.A. 2.x.x.x
==============

E.F.A stands for Email Filter Appliance.
E.F.A is born out of a need for a cost-effective email virus & spam scanning solution after the ESVA project died.

We try to create a complete package using existing open-source anti-spam projects and combine them to a single easy to use (virtual) appliance.
